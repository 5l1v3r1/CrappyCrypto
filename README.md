# CrappyCrypto
Want to "encrypt" your stuff with a totally not secure algorithm? You're in luck!

# Usage
```
Encrypt:
    echo "this is not secure" | ./crappycrypto.sh -e

Decrypt:
    cat encrypted.txt | ./crappycrypto.sh -d
```

# Disclaimer
It should be obvious by now: **do NOT not use this for "encrypting" anything you actually care about being private.** This is for fun only.

But I suppose, security through obscurity?
